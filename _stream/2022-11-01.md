    update: "So I'm getting ready to start prototyping a storage device using the BlueField DPU. I've managed to get my hands on an early POC device we had custom made, called the Blue Whale. I'll be writing up a bit more about it in hte future. No one really needs to know about it since it was a single run of a few hundred of these devices, but at the same time, it'd be a shame if it wasn't catalogged on the world wide web. Also, while I was making room in my server rack for these two Blue Whales I made the decision that my old GridCase 2 will be the recipient of the motherboard from my Dell 7390 laptop. The display is borked on it, but overall it's still a really good machine. Originally I was going to go bonkers and put in an EPYC processor, but budget and time just aren't going to allow it."
