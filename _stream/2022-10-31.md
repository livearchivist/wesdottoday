    update: "I've been back on my trello thing for a few weeks now. I have a column for each day of the week, Top of Mind (for the biggies, which are linked to smaller tasks), Backlog, and then a bunch of automations. So far, it's seeming to help me get stuff done. Every Monday, it clears the previous undone tasks by moving them to a column titled UNDONE, then creates a new one on Monday called Week Planning. I then sort through backlog and UNDONE and schedule my week according to what I think I can get done. I try to have one big hitter each day that will make me feel accomplished. It's basic, but it's working."
