                    <h3>Darkness</h3>
                    <p>2021 was full of darkness and exhaustion. Each and every person had their own darkness that they dealt with (or are still dealing with) as a result of being on guard for your personal safety from an adversary that is invisible to the naked eye. Being sceptical of every person you know, asking about vaccination records, what type of mask they wear when they go out, who they spend their time with - it's <i>exhausting</i>. I want to share a little bit of the darkness I went through during this on-going pandemic, as well as the light that I experienced.</p>

                    <h3>Light</h3>
                    <p>It will come as no surprise to anyone who follows me on Twitter or knows me personally that my wife and I spent 2018-2020 fighting infertility issues, IVF, stage IV endometriosis surgeries for my wife (two!), Eastern medicine, Western medicine, diet... all the things. After a failed round of IVF in May 2020 we were heartbroken, again. We spent several weeks dealing with sadness, deciding if we were going to do another round of IVF, and sitting with the idea that we may not have kids.</p> 
                    <p>It had been a long couple of years of throwing everything we could at infertility, from money, to doctors, to therapy, and we just didn't know if we had any fight left in us. Sometime in May or June we had settled into being okay with not having kids of our own, including adoption, because we had no fight left and adoption would be another fight that we didn't have left in us.</p>
                    <p>Then one morning, Missy came out of the bathroom with a goofy smile on her face, one I'd never seen before. <i>"I'm pregnant"</i> she said.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward to March of 2021 and here comes this beautiful little boy, Charlie! He's funny, cute, smart, determined, and so much fun.</p>
                    <p>After a few days in the hospital they let you take this little human home, it almost doesn't make sense. I think I drove at 50% the posted speed limit on back roads, while Missy doted on him in the back seat. Over the last nine months there has been so much laughter (<i>and tears</i>) in our home, so much happiness (<i>and frustration</i>), so much fun (<i>and boredom</i>), and no sleep.</p>

                    <h3>Ex-Communication</h3>
                    <p>You wouldn't imagine after having a baby that you'd have to fight with your family to get vaccinated, just to protect him. But, that's what I had to do. For months. And months. With no change in vaccination status. Though the decision to get vaccinated or not, is up to each individual, it's up to me to protect my child - which is what I've done. My dad met Charlie twice, outdoors with N95 masks. My mom, once. Neither has gotten vaccinated, nor will they. My mom was hospitalized with COVID and double pneumonia recently, even after that horrendous experience she still believes strongly that not getting vaccinated is the right thing for her.</p>
                    <p>With my mom, it's been mostly an unspoken agreement that she just won't see her grandson for the forseeable future and it absolutely breaks my heart. With my dad, it's been nine months of enduring arguing, disparaging comments, manipulation, and in a comical attempt at making me feel bad, quoting scripture at me.</p> 
                    <p>You see, my father is a text book narcisist, and has spent his entire life manipulating people to do what he wants them to do. As an executive, he's used to people just doing what he asks and not fighting back, of course as a side effect he's surrounded himself with yes-men (and yes, they're all men). After decades of being treated poorly, my entire adult life being treated as a child, and then the last nine months of him being nasty and manipulative, I finally said enough is enough. I cut off all communication with him.</p>
                    <p>It's amazing to me how much of my low-level anxiety was there because of this emotionally abusive relationship with my father. I didn't know it or realize it, it had just been something that I dealt with since I was a kid. As a young adult, when I still hadn't questioned my upbringing (religious, ultra-right) I thought that my dad was my biggest ally. That he would be there no matter what. I found out later though, as soon as I started to peel away from that ultra-right, religious, stranglehold on my mind, that he was only there as an ally when I believed everything he did. The moment I questioned my upbringing, what he believed in, it all changed.</p>
                    <p>I've been trying for a few years to put myself in his shoes. But, I can't. I can't fathom demonizing my child because they have different beliefs than myself. To constantly make underhanded comments about their political beliefs, their beliefs about science, their beliefs about equality and equity. I can't imagine refusing to honor my child's simple request to get vaccinated in order to see my grandchild, or even worse, belittling them and using the health of a grandparent or quoting bible verses to try and make them feel bad about their decision - all because it differed from mine. But, I'm not a narcisist, I don't believe that the world revolves around me, or that my beliefs are 100% perfect, true, and right - while everyone else's are not.</p>

                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p>I've built a family of my own, made up of people I can count on. Some are blood relatives, my siblings, some are relatives by choice, my wife, others are close friends, and even more, I've built a solid network of folks in the tech community that I can rely on for personal or professional support. Your family should be there to support and meet you where you are, challenge you, but not purposely hurt you.</p>
                    <p>In all of this, there was something that really hit me hard this year:</p>
                    <blockquote>We're all in this together and none of us knows what we're doing.</blockquote>
                    <p>There's no map, there's no instruction manual, no wiki, no <code>man</code> page, but there are <code>--help</code> flags. The only way I made it through the last year was with the support of a few close friends, my siblings, and my wife. I'm not someone that invokes the <code>--help</code> flag in life often, in fact I had to fire my therapist this year as it became increasingly clear that she was not going to be able to withhold her personal beliefs about religion each time I started to broach that subject, but when I have invoked the flag, there were people there to support me.</p>
                    <p>The same could be said for my career. I switched employers twice this year, the first place didn't stick and I struggled to make it work. I felt alone, on an island, there. There were people around, but I didn't feel as supported as I needed to in order to onboard well. I reached out to an acquaintance on Twitter to ask for some advice, he had some great advice and then he mentioned: <i>"Hey, I've got this req opening up... I know you just switched jobs, but it's for your exact skillset and I think we could work well together."</i></p> 
                    <p>It's not often that life is that obvious with offering opportunities, so we pursued the conversation a bit more and found that the opportunity (and team) was a perfect match for my skillset, interests, and work style. After nearly a month into the new job I can confirm that it was a perfect match for my skillset, interests, and work style. I was able to ship code within the first week and it was very clear what I needed to focus my attention on. I feel supported by my team and am set to do some great work in 2022.</p>
                    <p>During the process of switching jobs, both the first and second time, I talked to several trusted friends and Twitter acquaintances who I would now call friends. It's amazing what a support system there is out there in the tech community, if you just go looking for it. I've been lucky that the last decade (across a few different twitter handles), has brought together a group of helpful and wonderful people that I couldn't imagine being without. As imperfect as Twitter is, it's an amazing community builder.</p>

                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>I've been dabbling in helping individuals in their careers, doing resume reviews, connecting folks, and even helping one person find a job. It was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in a long time. It's something that I want to do more of in the New Year. I'm looking to work with one person per month, in a more formalized basis, <b>free of charge</b>, to help them find a job in tech, or a new job in tech. I'm thinking 30-60min per week, live discussion, resume review and update, career planning, and connecting them to people in the industry. We would work together for a month or so, during which, I would offer some tools to help improve their job hunt experience. </p>
                    <p>Something else I did towards the end of 2021 was do long format interviews with a few folks where we discuss their careers, their individual paths in the tech industry, and what interesting jobs are out there. So far I've done three interviews, which I plan on launching in the beginning of 2022, one every two weeks.</p>
                    <p>So for 2022, I've laid out some goals for myself, knowing that I'll probably miss the mark on some but that's okay:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be less snarky on the internet</li>
                        <li>Find a new therapise, attend semi-monthly</li>
                        <li>Continue interviewing tech folks, semi-monthly</li>
                        <li>One person per month of career mentoring</li>
                        <li>Move my body more</li>
                        <li>Read more, Write more</li>
                        <li>Drink less</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote>Be good to each other out there, we're all we have.</blockquote>
