I ♥ my Wife, Son, and 🐶

I put 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 over 💻

I enjoy a good 🥃 

I listen to, collect, and archive 🎷 Live Music

I'm working on improving 🌎 Indoor Air Quality

### Digging deeper

I care greatly about the people around me. That includes my family, friends, team mates, and the tech community I'm a part of on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesdottoday). I work with people who want to grow their careers, to direct them in directions they may not have found on their own, make introductions, and mentor when needed. I believe if we spent more of our time focusing on the people who work in tech, rather than on the tech itself, we would have a happier, healthier, more inclusive, and more productive industry. 

I always put my family over my career. I take breaks during my workday to spend time with my wife and son. I'll often go for a long walk with my son (1yo) to think about a problem or clear my head. I strive to be present in my life, although I don't always succeed. There will always be more work to do and more capitalism to feed, but our days our numbered and our time with loved ones is far too short.

I am recently diagnosed ADHD, which I'm finding to be a superpower when managed properly. Unfortunately, it's gone un-diagnosed and un-managed for close to two decades. It's amazing how clear things become and how much easier I'm finding it to focus on the project at hand now that it's being managed properly. 

I enjoy a good whiskey (boubon, scotch, Japanese whiskey, etc), particularly when sharing it with a friend. I think whiskey has the ability to transport us to different places, through different flavor profiles and memory association. Certain whiskies will remind me of time spent with a certain friend or of a place I've visited.

I have an obscenely large live music collection. Before a catastrophic hard drive failure (hard drives don't like to swim), I had just over 75TB of live music archived. I'm slowly building up my collection again, but I'm only allowing music into the collection once I've sanitized and cleaned the metadata, file names, etc. It's a lot of manual work, but I'm also trying to build a management tool to help automate some of this for me. 

Indoor Air Quality has become a big passion of mine in the last several years. After three years of infertility, my wife and I made a lot of changes in our lives. From the food we eat to the products we buy, we dive deep into the possible health consequences. This means that I've started to think a lot about what off-gases from products we buy (hello Ikea furniture). A friend and I are well along the way to designing some indoor air quality sensors that I will be using to build out a consultancy for down the road. In the end, I would like to spend my days making a difference in people's lives through improving their indoor air quality, rather than just building or marketing widgets in tech.
