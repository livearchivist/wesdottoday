I ♥ my Wife, Son, and 🐶

I put 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 over 💻

I listen to, collect, and archive 🎷 Live Music

I'm a budding gardener 🌱

I'm a hell of a technical marketer, datacenter architect, and systems designer. This is what currently pays the bills and will probably continue to do so for a little while.

### Digging deeper

I care greatly about the people around me. That includes my family, friends, team mates, and my technical community. I work with people who want to grow their careers, to direct them in directions they may not have found on their own, make introductions, and mentor when needed. I believe if we spent more of our time focusing on the people who work in tech, rather than on the tech itself, we would have a happier, healthier, more inclusive, and more productive industry. 

I always put my family over my career. I take breaks during my workday to spend time with my wife and son. I'll often go for a long walk with my young son to clear my head and see the world through his eyes. I strive to be present in my life, although I don't always succeed. There will always be more work to do and more capitalism to feed, but our days are numbered and our time with loved ones is far too short.

I am diagnosed and medicated ADHD, which I've known for decades but the social stigma and brainwashing I received growing up kept my parents and then me from pursuing diagnosis until my 30s. 

I have an obscenely large live music collection. Before a catastrophic hard drive failure (hard drives don't like to swim), I had just over 75TB of live music indexed and archived. I'm slowly building up my collection again, but I'm only allowing music into the collection once I've sanitized and cleaned the metadata, file names, etc. It's a lot of manual work, but I'm also trying to build a management tool to help automate some of this for me.
