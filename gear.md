Just like most folks in the tech industry, I take pride in the tools of my trade. Below you'll find a deep dive into my various machines, their uses, and how they're configured.

### boomboxx

`boomboxx` is the workhorse of the house. It's a monster machine that allows me to do just about anything I need to. I am considering picking up a Mac Studio as a possible replacement, but I'm not entirely sold on the idea.

**Specs**

- Boxx Apexx T4 Everest
- AMD Threadripper PRO 3975WX 32-Cores @ 4.2GHz
- 512GB memory
- (2) Micron 1.92TB NVMe

- NVIDIA CX-6 200G NIC

**Software**

### swanson 

`swanson` is my new personal laptop. It replaces a very tired Thinkpad T480s (`maracapants`) and should last me a very long time, given its #righttorepair roots.

## Retired Machines

### maracapants (retired)

`maracapants` is my personal laptop that gets used for lots of random projects. It's most likely going to be replaced in the next year or so with a M2 MacBook Air.

**Specs**

- 24GB Memory
- 2TB NVMe

**Software**

- Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop
