I do not make my living by consulting and as such, I've set my consulting rates with what I believe to be equitable when taking into account my experience, available time, and value I can bring to your organization. I am happy to work with you to help design a Technical Marketing program, datacenter/application architecture and design, and many other things. I believe that it is in everyone's best interest that we are upfront about expectations and how we will work best together.
