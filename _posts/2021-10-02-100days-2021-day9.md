Spoiler Alert: I didn't get back to code

I did, however, make some modifications to the design of the base enclosure. I put in a hexagon pattern to help reduce the amount of time it takes to print, use less filament, and look kind of cool. Right now the printer is finishing up the first version of the base enclosure done this way and I've already idenitifed a few issues that will require a re-print. I think I'm going to end up slowly dialing in this design in over time.
