I _think_ I have the printer dialed in to a level of acceptability, at least for what I need it to do for this project right now. The printer was UNDER-extruding, rather than over, by a significant margin. So after so tweaks, I feel like it should be enough to give me something to work with. 

All of the sensors will actually be attached to an insert that slides into the base, so I will need to design that next. I'm trying to decide how I'm going to bring in the air for testing, whether I have holes for each sensor or a pattern of holes across the entire surface of the lid. The latter would allow for greater re-use of parts down the road.
