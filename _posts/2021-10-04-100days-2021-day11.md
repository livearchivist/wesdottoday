Spoiler Alert: I didn't get back to code

Yesterdays print failed spectactularly. I left the checkbox for generating structural support checked and it ended up generating way more structural support than I could ever remove. It was a really odd print. 

I designed and printed the first sensor insert, then designed the carriers for each of the sensors. The carriers are meant to be replaceable and customized to each sensor's needs.
