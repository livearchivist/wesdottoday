Since I wrote _[Moving Countries a Thought Exercise](/moving-countries-a-thought-exercise)_ several things have changed: I no longer work for Druva, our home equipment has simplified a bit further, and probably a few other things I don't remember at the moment. 

As always, you can see a full debrief of the gear I use [here](/gear).

All computers and servers will be backed up and wiped before transportation.

### Backup Methods

All machines will be backed up in the following manner:

- BorgBase
- Borg to USB SSD 1
- Borg to USB SSD 2
- Borg to secondary NAS at friend's house

The backup USB SSDs will be placed into two [Pelican 1400 Protector Cases](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1400). Each case will have two SSDs. One case will ship to a friend in Arkansas, while the other will follow us a week or so after we move.

### Machines

`boomboxx`

This mother-trucker is big, heavy, and very expensive. At 20"x19"x8" it'll take a seriously large Pelican Case to transport it. The machine has (2) A6000 graphics cards, a DPU, and a PCI slot NVMe expander that will need to be removed and packed separately. 

The Boxx will fit in a [Pelican 1640 Protector Transport Case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/transport-case/protector/1640), while the PCI cards will be wrapped in anti-static bags and placed in a [Pelican 1460 Protector Case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1460).

`maracapants`

This laptop will most likely be upgraded before any move like this, but the new one will be treated the same way. I will pack it in a [Pelican 1440 Top Load Protector Case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/top-loader-case/protector/1440) along with my work 16" MacBook Pro and my wife's MacBook.

`wkennedy-mlt`

Just like my personal laptop, I will pack it in a [Pelican 1440 Top Load Protector Case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/top-loader-case/protector/1440).

`goofynewton`

The drives will be pulled out of the NAS and then it will be placed in a [Pelican 1610 Protector Case](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1610). The drives will be put in [ORICO 3.5" Hard Drive Cases](https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Protective-Portable-Anti-Static-Anti-Shock/dp/B008JA2HNG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1ZFPKIUVMWA1J&keywords=3.5+hard+drive+case&qid=1653361142&sprefix=3.5+hard+drive+case%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-3) and stored in the 1610 with the NAS.
