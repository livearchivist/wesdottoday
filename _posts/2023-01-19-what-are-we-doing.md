What's the point of all the labor we do? Why do you get up every day and open your laptop? Why do we spend 30-90 hours a week banging away on a keyboard, reading mindless status updates, building things for the sake of what... profit? Whose profit? Certainly not yours.

Lately I've been spending a lot of time thinking about the value of our labor and how it impacts the lives of people and the health of our planet. So much of our time is spent on driving shareholder value and building the latest and greatest widget, but are we actually making anything better?

I feel as if we're caught in a trap (we are). Capitalism has been designed to ensure that a few rich and powerful folks continue to get richer and more powerful, while everyone else labors away for decades just to pay their bills and survive. After millions of years on this planet, are we really just here for survival? Did we build all this technology and labor away just to continue to work and not enjoy the lives we're given?

How do we break out of these patterns? How do we continue to provide for our families while trying to build a better world? I don't have a lot of answers so far, but here's what I do have...

## Life's Work

[What is your life's work?](https://wes.today/what-is-your-lifes-work/) 

I'd like to report that I am making slow, unsteady progress on my life's work of improving indoor air quality. I'm actively designing sensors for deployment in homes to help give poeple actionable data about their indoor air quality. My business partner and I are working hard defining what we'd like the company focus to be, how we will support communities who are unable to spend several hundred dollars on air sensors for their homes, and how we can turn raw sensor data into something that is actionable for the greater world.

We plan on aggregating and anonymizing data (on an opt-in basis) and making it available to research institutions, companies who are focusing on improving indoor air quality, and healthcare innovators who need quality data to help improve the air that people breathe. 

We will always remain open with our company structure, finances, and what we do with the data that we collect (once again, I'm stressing that this will be anonymized and opt-in). Our platforms will always be open source, including the schematics for those who may want to save money and build their own units. 

So how does that translate back to my life's work? What do I want to be able to point to and say "I did that"? 

I want the work I do to accomplish a few key things: Educate, Innovate, and Change.

### Educate

Most people are under-informed or miss-informed on how air quality affects their health. There are those that aren't interested in learning, but for everyone else, it's primarily due to a lack of being presented with a simple way to consume information about air quality and how it affects their health. Unfortunately, the lack of education isn't just regular consumers, it also includes doctors, the trades (HVAC, Painters, etc), educators (teachers, principals, etc), and landlords. 

I want to help create content that helps educate these individuals in a way that they can easily consume and understand it, hopefully influencing how they approach their specific trade. I am pretty connected in the construction industry in our area, so I will be starting there. Particularly with
