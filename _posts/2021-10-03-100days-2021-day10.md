Spoiler Alert: I didn't get back to code

Looking so much better! I'll add a picture tomorrow once this is done printing. I had to do quite a few structural changes to make sure it remains nice and strong. I re-designed the lid to have the same pattern. It'll turn out well as well. The current print should be done at 0700, so I'll start the lid after that.

This week I really want to focus on the code. I need to get everything pushed into Github and setup the build pipeline to create the docker images for ARM and AMD64.
