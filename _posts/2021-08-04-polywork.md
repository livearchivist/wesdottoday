About a month ago I managed to get ahold of a code to join [Polywork](https://bit.ly/3lhG50U). I've never been a fan of LinkedIn and just use Twitter to complain to the world, so I felt instantly at home when I realized that Polywork was the intersection of those two apps in a way that makes me want to use it. 

LinkedIn puts a big emphasis on the companies you've worked for and the jobs you've held in them, when your contribution to your work community is most likely much greater than your role or title. Not often do you get a chance to brag on the work you actually **do**, instead we plug away at the job and do our best to remember what we did come review time.

Twitter is mostly full of shitposters, myself included, who just fill your timeline with noise. Sometimes there's a gem out there, but Twitterers are not really incentivized to put out quality content, instead noise is produced. That's part of the reason I use a service to delete my Tweets after they're two weeks old. What that leaves though, is a gap.

Stuff that's not corporate enough for LI but isn't noise, where does that land? 

This is where Polywork has hit the nail on the head. They've realized that as individuals we're more than the cog in the machine and we should sell ourselves that way. A lot of us give talks that are related to our industry, but not our jobs. Some of us maintain open source code. Others build websites on the side or just blog about the work they do. All of these things add up to who we are in our jobs, but the nuances are missed on other platforms.

Not only did Polywork get the nuance right, they did it in such a way that they're getting rid of the worst parts of those other social mediums and making it actually beautiful and fun to use. It's cute, quirky, and a joy to use. I actually get excited when I have something new to post, not because I'll get likes (there aren't any - please keep it that way), but because it means I've contributed to the community in some way.

So let's take a quick look around!

### Profile

The profile is broken into five sections:
* Profile Image and personal assistant
* All your details
* Your tags, these can be profession or personal, what matters most to you
* An "About Me" kind of area
* And lastly, your positions. 

The tags are my most favorite part of Polywork. They give you the ability to link to folks who may not be in your industry but happen believe in [Open Compensation](https://www.polywork.com/badges/open-compensation-advocate) or be a [Whisky Enthusiast](https://www.polywork.com/badges/whisky-enthusiast) like me, or any other tags you put on your profile. Life is more than just the job you do or the roles you take, so this is a really cool way to separate people from their job titles and show them as individuals, rather than just cogs in the machine. 

### Highlights

The Highlights section is where you'll see all of a persons previous accomplishments. I've been using it to announce any content that I work on, such as blog posts, websites, etc, and when I appear on Webinars or other speaking engagements. In the future, like [Rich Burroughs](https://blog.richburroughs.dev/polywork-is-much-more-than-the-new-linkedin) said, it will be a major help for me come review and OKR time to see what I've been working on.

It's a beautiful implementation with Badges that you assign to keep track of the "how". These are not status updates, these are not tweets, they're a badge of honor saying I built or did this thing in the community. These Highlights are items meant to be celebrated, just as we are, as creators and doers. 

Oh, and they're serious about fixing the verification mess that is Twitter Verified. It's a lot less about popularity and more about just validating that these people are who they say they are. I'm still waiting on my verification to begin, but I imagine they're pretty busy right now continuing to provide more value for their users!

There are many more aspects to Polywork, including the Multiverse and Space Station, but I've yet to dig in too deeply into those. I highly recommend you use my code `wesdottoday` to get out there and [join Polywork](https://bit.ly/3lhG50U), I don't think you'll regret it.
