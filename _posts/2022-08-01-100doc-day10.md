I've done a few rounds of 100 Days of Code in the past, but never really made it past 2 weeks. Part of the reason for that failure is the weekend portion - I don't like to computer on the weekend since I computer very hard during the week.

I decided it would be a really good use of my time to work on my Indoor Air Quality platform as a part of my attempt at 100 Days of Code. It's the next step for me in my career, so I need a way to force my effort. 

There are two parts to making my IAQ platform successful, the sensors themselves, and the backend system.

### Previous Days

- [Day 1](/100doc-day1) - Getting the infrastructure setup for development
- [Day 2](/100doc-day2) - Getting basic data out of Temp/Hum sensor, figuring out scope for others
- [Day 3](/100doc-day3) - Publish data to InfluxDB
- [Day 4](/100doc-day4) - Handled some errors in the publisher, got CouchDB up adn running
- [Day 5](/100doc-day5) - Slack bot alerts!
- [Day 6](/100doc-day6) - Health Checks babay!
- [Day 7](/100doc-day7) - Ansible and other things for a friend's project
- [Vacation](/100doc-vacation) - I'm on vacation so haven't been coding much
- [Day 8](/100doc-day8) - `Makefile` to test, build, push multiple docker containers to Github registry
- [Day 9](/100doc-day9) - Large refactor to use Flask API instead of reading results from files. 

### Day 10

Yesterday was a big change to the code, but introduced a bug where only `temperature_c` would be written to InfluxDB. As you can see in the image above, neither graph was updating because they weren't receiving new data. If I would have had a Celsius chart, I probably would have found the error sooner. 

To solve the issue, first I got logging properly sorted for Flask, including allow you to set the level in a variable. In the future, I'd like to set this as an environment varible in `docker-compose.yml`.

Once I did that, I was able to find that the `for` loop that parsed and published each point of data from the `payload` would `return` at the end of the `for` statement, causing the whole loop to end. It was pretty simple from there to move the return statement outside of the `for` loop, causing it to return only when each point in the `payload` has been processed. 

Overall, I'd label today's coding session as a success.
