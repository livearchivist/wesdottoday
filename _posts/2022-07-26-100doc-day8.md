I've done a few rounds of 100 Days of Code in the past, but never really made it past 2 weeks. Part of the reason for that failure is the weekend portion - I don't like to computer on the weekend since I computer very hard during the week.

I decided it would be a really good use of my time to work on my Indoor Air Quality platform as a part of my attempt at 100 Days of Code. It's the next step for me in my career, so I need a way to force my effort. 

There are two parts to making my IAQ platform successful, the sensors themselves, and the backend system.

### Previous Days

- [Day 1](/100doc-day1) - Getting the infrastructure setup for development
- [Day 2](/100doc-day2) - Getting basic data out of Temp/Hum sensor, figuring out scope for others
- [Day 3](/100doc-day3) - Publish data to InfluxDB
- [Day 4](/100doc-day4) - Handled some errors in the publisher, got CouchDB up adn running
- [Day 5](/100doc-day5) - Slack bot alerts!
- [Day 6](/100doc-day6) - Health Checks babay!
- [Day 7](/100doc-day7) - Ansible and other things for a friend's project
- [Vacation](/100doc-vacation) - I'm on vacation so haven't been coding much

### Day 8

Today I worked on setting up a `Makefile` to test, build, push multiple docker containers to Github registry. The tests will be run to lint the code I've written, then build each container by `cd`'ing into each subfolder, then push each tagged image to the registry. From here I want to build out a testing suite that runs on commit, using Github Actions. The idea would be, I push code to the repo, GH Actions runs the Makefile, where the test, build, push, occurs - then is followed by a test deployment which gets tested for application level items. Should be a nice way for me to test things without having to deal with manually copying files everywhere. Anyways, below you'll find the `Makefile` as I've written it.

``` make

DOCKER_TAG := $(shell date +%Y-%m-%d)
