I've done a few rounds of 100 Days of Code in the past, but never really made it past 2 weeks. Part of the reason for that failure is the weekend portion - I don't like to computer on the weekend since I computer very hard during the week.

I decided it would be a really good use of my time to work on my Indoor Air Quality platform as a part of my attempt at 100 Days of Code. It's the next step for me in my career, so I need a way to force my effort. 

There are two parts to making my IAQ platform successful, the sensors themselves, and the backend system.

### Previous Days

- [Day 1](/100doc-day1) - Getting the infrastructure setup for development
- [Day 2](/100doc-day2) - Getting basic data out of Temp/Hum sensor, figuring out scope for others

### Day 3

Good progress has been made today, primarily on the Publisher container. The publisher reads data from file (`*.json`) in a shared volume that all sensor containers mount. Each sensor container write's it's data in a relatively simple json format, which then the publisher consumes. Eventually, I'll want to move this to some sort of API/gRPC call between containers, but I'm not concerned with the wear on the disks for now. 

The Publisher then formats the data in a manner in which we can push into InfluxDB. The publisher formats each data point as a "Point" and then writes it to InfluxDB. It writes two copies, one in the customer bucket, the other in `vgt_customer_lake`. The Data Lake will contain anonymized data, that's reported at a regional location basis, that we can use to help build and train models for future use. 

I then created a very basic dashboard, reporting the Air Quality score, Temperature (f), and Humidity in my office. Once I get the 3D printed case sorted out, I'll put together a few more units that I can deploy around the house. 

Tomorrow I'll get back to working on getting data out of the other 3 sensors connected to the device.

(Yes, it's hot as balls in my office. Blame my [workstation](/gear))

I've also got Grafana tied in, where we can make charts and dashboards if necessary.
