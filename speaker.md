## Travel and Engagement

If you would like me to attend or speak at your event, please reach out and we can see if it's a good fit. I'm very passionate about the intersection of humans and tech, largely the humans who work in tech, not our experience with the tech itself. I'd love to engage with you in a productive conversation on how we can make our community a more inclusive, equitable, and happy place for people to work - or even better - have discussions on how we can use the huge amount of influence our industry has on the collective conscience to do something good for the planet and humans, instead of soley further enriching capitalistic institutions and billionaires.

I often need 3-4 months advanced notice in order to work in the time to prepare for a trip such as this and obviously more time is better. A brief introduction to your company, the event, dates, asks of me, and any other information you can provide are all **extremely** helpful for me to make my decision. I will personally review any request and reply directly regarding my possible attendance at an event.
