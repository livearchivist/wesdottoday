### Stuff

### Tech

#### Hardware

Right now I have a ton of tech hardware. Unfortunately I've built up a collection of stuff that will take a long time to divest and sell. Over the next few weeks you'll see a yardsale page go up, where I'll be selling items that I no longer need or want. 

I will be shrinking down to the following hardware, but I don't necessarily own all these devices yet. 

**Personal**

- [x] Lenovo Laptop (T480S, 24GB, 1TB NVMe) (running NixOS)
- [x] iPhone 12 Pro
- [x] Apple Watch
- CyberDecks (in progress to build)
- (2) USB-C External SSDs (for backups, stored in Pelican cases, one in safety deposit box)

**Family**

- [x] Intel NUC Pro (64GB, 3x500GB NVMe, 2.5GbE NIC) - (CoreDNS, Caddy Proxy, Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, etc)
- Qnap TS-873A-8G 8 Bay NAS (2x250GB NVME, 8x14TB HDD, 2.5GbE NIC)

Currently my Plex server and it's associated storage live in a huge Supermicro server with way too much power. It's going to be the first to go, but I need to buy the Qnap first to replace it. I'm thinking I should be able to break even on that deal.
