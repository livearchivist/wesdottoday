Wes (2008),

Hi there, I know you're trying to figure out how all this adulting works and you're appearing to handle it well but inside you're struggling. Things do get better, they do get easier. 

To make things easier for you now though, you really need to slow down and think about some things. Stop eating out, you can't afford it. You've been conditioned to think it's just $8-$10 for lunch, but it's not. It's $8-$10 for lunch, 20 days a month, when you're living paycheck to paycheck. You're paying for these lunches by taking out more school loans than necessary for your education.

Speaking of the education, stop the bleeding now. You're working in IT, you're learning a lot, you're taking out loans to pay for the education that you're mostly failing, so stop now. If you feel the need to return and finish down the road you can, but you don't need to keep punishing your future self with loans that will drag you down as you're trying to build a career.

You really can't afford that house - seriously. 

There are going to be some big life changes coming up, whatever you do, slow down, breathe, it will be okay. 

Be nicer to the people around you, check your ego, spend more time with your friends.

Start that
