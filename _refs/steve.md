description: "Steve, the owner of Trevor Custom Homes, is a great general contractor who you can trust to get the job done. He did our _nearly_ entire home remodel, including addition, which you can see on his website. If you work with Steve, it'll be a handshake deal with a rough estimated costs. He's always in contact with you keeping you up to date on any changes or issue they run into. His sub-contractors are all solid and do a great job. We will be using Steve again soon to redo our Master Bathroom, one of the last projects left in the house."
