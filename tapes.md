Tapes is a music metadata management tool designed for huge libraries. Specifically focussing on Live Music, it doubles down on ensuring that file consistency is number one and that your file metadata is perfect.

In the future there will be a system to allow you to share your shows with people that are looking to collect. Shows you're missing but are available on the network will show up as _ghost_ shows in your library.
