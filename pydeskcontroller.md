This project is a one-off that will offer simple desk control of my Sonos speakers in my office. It will use a square HyperPixel display to show artwork and track details, have a rotary encoder for volume and other controls, as well as a neopixel ring behind the encoder to show various status.

When my camera motion sensor triggers, the display will temporarily show a camera feed as well.

My plan is for the controller to be placed in a beautiful, heavy, wood enclosure and have a giant brass or aluminum knob.
