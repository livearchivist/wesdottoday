Neutron is a distributed air quality testing platform. Originally this was born out of the desire to monitor the air quality in our own home, then the project expanded to do IAQ testing for homes as a service. 

I am working on building the platform as a part of 100 Days of Code.

### Neutron

Neutron is the central server running InfluxDB, CouchDB and some helper scripts.

### Neutrino

A Neutrino is a sensor node that runs a custom Python application to pull data from the environmental sensors on board and report that data back to the Neutron on network.
