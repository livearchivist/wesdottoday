<p>Hi there! I'm Wes Kennedy. This is my little part of the web where I constantly modify and hack at things based on my mood.</p>
<p>You'll find blog posts, gear lists, and other randoms throughout my site. Head over to my <a href="/about">About</a> page if you're interested to learn more about me or my career.</p>
<p>Like many people, my writing comes and goes. I've lost a lot of it to time, bad migrations, and heavy editing. Anything that remains posted I still stand by.</p> 
<p>I'm happy you're here. I love sharing my thoughts with people and diving deep into certain subjects, which for me right now my interests are heavily focussed on NixOS and Indoor Air Quality.</p>
