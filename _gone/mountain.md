_Buy a mountain._

_You need to buy a mountain._

These are the thoughts that Bram woke up with. Even though he should be working on his next project or checking in to see that the work he did to bury Chief Roberts was complete, he just couldn't shake the new project that he came up with the night before. Whiskey induced ideas tend to stick for him. 

Originally he thought he would build the vault in Scotland, but he realized he has a lot of work that happens in Japan and the greater area, so why not build it there?

He dialed ZZZFlights, his prefered underground private flight company. 

"Yeah?" Said the voice on the phone

"Glasgow to Osaka, tomorrow, one-way," he replied in the expected short form.

"Aye, at'll be 60 at 0600." Replied the voice.

"Slainte"

Bram knew that the voice was stating that the trip would cost 60 ounces of gold and depart at 0600 the next morning. Bram grabbed his bag and an empty rolling case and went out the door. He hopped in the car, but paused for a moment. "The whisky bottle," he muttered to himself. He went back in the house to retrieve the bottle of Hibiki that he didn't finish the night before and stashed that in his bag. Then he sped off into town.

He pulled up to Campbeltown Bank and went inside. He went to the private banking desk and handed over his passport. 

"Mr. MacGregor, how might I help you?" said the woman at the desk.

"I need to access boxes 1722, 1184, and 1455," Bram responded, taking his passport back and handing her his keycard.

She validated the keycard for access, then returned it to him. 

"Right this way," she said pleasantly. 

She opened the vault and ushered Bram inside. She pulled the door and locked it behind them. Once the door was secure she tapped her keycard on the proper boxes, then quietly exited the vault. 

Bram opened 1184 with his keycard and pulled out the box inside, placing it on the table in the center of the room. He pulled a key out of his bag and unlocked the box. The box clearly held a few million worth of gold. He counted out 10x 10oz bars and placed them in his bag. He knew he would need a little bit of extra gold to get settled in Japan, since he was unsure how long he would be in country. 

He closed up 1184 and then opened up 1722 and 1455. Both had very large containers inside of them, but thankfully the box has a drawer bottom allowing him to pull out the container and open it up. Bram unlocked the box using the same key as the other box, revealing kilo sized gold bars. He pulled 20 kilo bars out and placed them in the rolling case he brought with him, closing 1722 empty. He pulled another 20 kilos out of 1455 and placed them in the rolling case. 

With his heavy case in tow, he walked out of the vault and out to the car. With about $2.5M in gold in in his luggage, he started off towards Glasgow. He kept to busy roads and drove with the speed of traffic as he always does, not wanting to call too much attention to himself. 

He phoned a friend who lives in Glasgow to ask if he could stay for a night, which was met with a quick yes.

Liam opened the door and gave Bram a big hug. "Bram my boy, how the hell are ya?" he asked.

"Doing fine thanks, and yourself?"

"Ah you know, one foot in front of the other. Six feet above ground and all that. Did you bring anything to share?" Always cutting to the chase, he loved when Bram would stay because he always brought good whisky.

"Of course."

"Then you're allowed in," joked Liam. 

There were few people in the world that Bram trusted implicitly. Bram's trust is hard to earn and hard to shake. He would go to the ends of the Earth to help the few people in the world that he trusts.

He pulled out the Hibiki 30 and placed it on the counter, while Liam grabbed two glasses. Bram poured each of them a more than hefty pour and sat down on the couch. 

"So what are you working on now?" Liam asked.

"Well, it's something you might be interested in. You have a few skill that may come in handy for the job."

"Oh?" Liam said, sitting up a bit in his chair. 

"I want to build another vault, in Japan, in a mountain. 100,000 bottle capacity."

Liam choked a bit on his drink. "100,000 bottles?" 

"Should I make it 200,000? A cool mill?" Bram smiled, leaning back in his chair.

Liam sat in silence for a moment thinking about the proposition. "What's your goal here?"

"I want to build the most exclusive clubs in the world, something that is invite only, offering access to the worlds largest whiskey library, interesting members, and utmost privacy."

"Is that all?" prodded Liam. 

"Probably not," smiled Bram.

They both leaned back for a little while enjoying their whisky.

"So tell me more about the mountain" lead Liam.

"Well, I want the vault to be 100 Meters deep and about 15 Meters wide. Seat no more than 6. It should have an extremely well hidden entrance that people will have to work to get to. I'm thinking either by helicopter or boat via a cliff entrance."

"Okay, that seems easy enough. And you're wanting to build this in Japan, in one of their mountains, without anyone noticing, and then have people arrive by helicopter or boat? Now that's what makes it a challenge." Liam paused to finish his glass.

"Look," Liam says leaning toward Bram, "pick any one of those and you've got a challenge. Putting them all together and you've got something that's a challenge. What time does the flight take off?"

"0600"

"Great we've got time to finsih this bottle."

An early morning flight after a late evening of drinking was never easy for Bram, but Liam seemed to bounce back like nothing happened. 

They took a cab to the airport, into the private air terminal. There was only one Gulfstream ready for boarding, so they went straight to that plane. The flight attendant walked down the stairs and met them at their car. 

"May I help you with your bags?" She asked, in a Brittish accent.

"Thank you, but I'll hold on to mine and the case is awfully heavy." Bram replied.

"You can take my bags so I can help Bram with the case," said Liam.

Inside, they could see that the jet was well appointed and should make for a comfortable journey.

"How long is the flight?" Asked Liam

"There's about 14 hours of flight time from here to Osaka. We should be arriving around 4am local time, we have a car arranged to pick you up and take you to our partner hotel. Feel free to settle in and get comfortable." Replied the flight attendant.

"Great, thanks."

The first several hours of the flight were smooth and provided Liam and Bram some more time to discuss the particulars of their plan. Liam had a couple dozen reliable builders, steel workers, and miners that he could trust that would be willing to work anywhere in the world, for a cool $1M USD per year.

"I trust them implicitly. I've worked with each one of them for more than ten years." Pushed Liam

"What about an architect?" Asked Bram

"The guy that designed vaults one and two retired, but I've heard good things about his son. I'll reach out to them and see if they're open to any new projects."

Bram spent a good portion of the flight reaching out to contacts in Japan looking for someone who might be able to be their guide and help them locate a suitable building location. Thankfully, he was able to identify a contact from nearly a decade ago who had access to a helicopter, pilot, and knew the mountains pretty well. They agreed on a fee of 25 ounces of gold for a week and was told that he would meet them at their hotel in two days.

"If this works, I think we should build a one million bottle vault in the Swiss Alps," said Liam after a long silent period.

"You just like spending my money don't you?" replied Bram, "And yes, we should."

Mount My≈çken is breathtaking in it's beauty, while offering a reasonable amount of tree cover to hide any access points. It is also surrounded by smaller towns and a few temples, many of whom might look the other way with the right donations to the province or temples. 

Bram and Liam had no intention of purchasing the land, not because Bram couldn't afford it, but mostly because the land wouldn't be for sale at all. There's also the fact that it adds to the appeal of the vault that it's hidden away in the mountains of Japan, without the authorities even being aware that it exists. 

"I think I'd like to hike around on foot to examine that area a bit closer," Bram stated over the comms on the helicopter, while pointing to a small ridge. "I think we could build an entrance under that ridgeline. It'd be completely hidden, while still allowing access via helicopter."

"Wouldn't multiple helicopters per day prove to be rather conspicuous?" Asked Denji.

"Yes, I suspect it would. We should think about other ways to get our members there."

"What if... No, nevermind," said Liam.

"Spit it out," Bram replied.

"Okay, this might be a little crazy, but... What if we had a submarine that would dock with an underwater air lock, which leads to an access tunnel, then an elevator taking them to the entrance?"

"Yes, that's the answer!" Exclaimed Denji. 

"Not so fast. That's a really big lift. Something that requires cartel level tunneling skills." replied Bram.

"Good thing I know some of their best tunneling folks" said Liam.

"Are they freelancers? I don't want to deal with the cartels directly." 

"It's an entirely separate business. It's all these people do, build tunnels. I've seen some of them. Some even look like what you'd see in military installations. Aluminum or Steel walls, well lit, air conditioning, the works."

"Pilot, do you know of somewhere we can rent a submarine and captain?" Asked Bram.

"I just might. I will ask around quietly. We'll go in for a ladder drop in about 30 seconds so you all can hike about. I will return in two hours to pick you up at the exact same location."

"Copy." Liam said simply.
