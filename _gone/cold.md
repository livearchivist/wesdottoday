It's a hard thing to fall off the radar from all authorities, become a citizen of nowhere, and yet still move around the planet without raising alarms. Even if you're not a fugitive, governments don't particularly like not being able to collect their tax revenue. Even though Bram falls entirely off the radar of law enforcement and tax enforcement agencies worldwide, he still manages to live a fairly normal life without a much worry about what is around the corner. In fact, he has even been known to play in a local poker game from time to time, that even includes the local chief of police. Of course, the chief knows Bram as William, but that's just one of many aliases Bram has used over the years. 

Although Bram isn't a fugivitive, all that means is know one knows what he does for a living or even that he exists. The maxim _"Knowledge is power"_ is what Bram lives his life by, except that he's less interested in power and more interested in continuing to live his life in peace, without the scruitiny of governments or other people telling him what to do. For more than 15 years Bram has been moving valuable information around the planet, offline, away from prying eyes. He has petabytes of data stored in private caches around the world. His caches are full of secrets from the worlds largest governments, corporations, and influential people. Video footage of politicians committing crimes, data detailing spy programs, blueprints of highly valuable products, and so much more. The data he has collected over the years could take down entire continents worth of countries, start world wars (or end them), and collapse the world's economic markets. 

Bram isn't an anarchist, nor is he a capitalist, he operates by his own code - one that is focused on doing good for people at the expense of corporations or governments that are hurting them. Injustice is intolerable in his eyes and he will do anything he can to correct those wrongs. 

_"Shit, it's cold."_ He muttered under his breath, as he walked the 20 meters to his vehicle. The old diesel truck had been idling for 15 minutes warming up, but he could tell it was still struggling. 

He tossed his go bag in the back of the truck and hopped in the cab, throwing his field bag across the bench seat. He pulled off his gloves and tried to warm them by blowing into them. Nunavat in February is mostly inhospitable, as evidenced by the thermometer reading on the dashboard, -30C.  

The heater had been working over time in the truck, but it had mostly warmed it up to a comfortable temperature. Even though it was a little after 0400, he still took a moment to check the CB radio, hitting a few key channels that were useful for tracking anyone that may be nearby, but found everything to be quiet. 

Bram put the truck into drive and the small cabin in the rear view mirror. After he got to be about 1/2 kilometer away he stopped the truck and pulled a custom remote out of his pack. He chose "Cabin-4" from the menu, then flipped the red safety cover up and pressed the button. 

**Thud** was all he heard. Then, **Thud** and a quiet roar. He looked back to see a hole where his cabin (and data well) had been and a small avalanche building steam heading down the directly adjacent mountain. His plan had worked, the cabin and all evidence gone, quickly filled in by an avalache. He put the remote back in his bag and put the truck back in gear to make the 45 minute trek into town. 

---

Even with the weather being as cold as it is, the pilot appeared to be comfortable in his flight jacket and overalls, leaning against his plane waiting for Bram to arrive. Bram put the truck in park about 50 meters away from the plane, grabbed his bags, and walked towards the plane. He shook the pilot's hand, handed him the keys and registration to the truck, and boarded. 

An old pickup for a flight out of town seemed like a perfectly reasonable deal to Bram. Everything in his life was expendable, with few exceptions. Homes, clothing, technology, even countries, very few things mattered on the grand scale. 

Once boarded on the small 4 person air craft, he donned the headset, and performed a "Check 1, 2" with the pilot responding "Acknowledged". 

"I will leave you in silence for a majority of the flight, I'm not much of a talker when in the pilot's seat" the pilot said to Bram.

"Sounds good." He replied simply.

The pilot flipped some switches, started up the plane, did a quick check of the systems, and then began to taxi down the runway. Bram never liked taking off in these small aircraft, particularly on runways that come and go with the seasons. 

After they reached their cruising altitude, Bram relaxed a bit and started running through his mental list of things he does when he burns a site. 

- Full deep clean in gloves
- Set thermite charges in well to burn through all data storage devices
- Set C4 explosives to level building
- Set C4 explosives to cover up building (in this case, create avalanche)
- Full wipe down of vehicle

Bram has spent years honing his trade, understanding how to stay under the radar, removing any trace of his presence, and leave people just curious enough about who he is without making them want to ask a bunch of questions. Most people are too self-involved to worry too much about the people they interact with infrequently, so it's only the people he sees more regularly that he ensures hear a fully developed backstory. Thankfully he had a person for that.

He felt good knowing that he had been thorough in covering his tracks and was frankly very happy to be leaving Nunavut behind him. It was cold, dry, and perfect for long term archives of data, but after cleaning out the chief of police a few weeks back in a game of poker, he realized that his days were numbered. Chief Roberts was known to hold a grudge and he would start digging deeper than Bram would like. Thankfully, Bram would be on the other side of the planet by the time the chief realized that William Manns was a figment and would never be seen again.

The landing in Wekweeti was rough, causing even the seasoned bush pilot to swear while trying to get the plane to settle on the ground. Bram quickly departed the plane and entered the small terminal. There were a few pilots sitting at the bar, who Bram approached. He sat down next to the pilot on the end and ordered a whiskey and a refill for the pilot. 

The pilot raised the glass in thanks saying, "Names Peter."

"James", said Bram, raising his glass in response.

"Where you headin' James?"

"Dawson City," he replied.

"That's a hike from here. You looking for transportation?"

"Yes, I am. You have a plane capable of the journey?"

"Ah yeah, I've done that route a few times. A lot of folks wanting to strike it rich in the mining business. You're not heading out there for that are you?" The pilot asked, making small talk, but pushing his luck with what Bram was willing to admit. 

"I thought I might give it a try. I've got a line as an operator on someone's claim." Bram lied.

The pilot chuckled and sighed. "It's a little early in the season, I hope you have a room booked. I'll do it for an ouce of gold"

"I don't have any gold yet friend, I don't suppose you would accept cash?"

"I'll tell you what, there's a gold dealer next to the airport in Dawson, convert that cash to gold and we've got a deal."

Bram shook the pilot's hand. 

"Leave in the morning. 0500." The pilot said, holding up two fingers to the bartender.

---

Dawson City is bustling during mining season, but during the winter it's quite cold and quiet. Bram had exchanged $250,000 CAD into gold, of which, he handed over 1oz to the pilot. He knew that Dawson City was used to handling large transactions in cash and gold, no one batting an eye (or reporting any transactions) at someone wanting to transact with either of the two, even in large sums. 

Now that his bag was significantly lighter, he stopped by the general store to pick up some new clothing. He found a pair of jeans, a few long sleeve shirts, and a new pair of boots. Following the store, he walked down the street and found a hotel which appeared comfortable and secure. 

He got a room for a month, which would give him plenty of time to buy the plane and complete some work on it before moving on to the next leg of his journey. 

He spent the next few days resting, it would be a long few weeks to prepare the plane for the next legs of his journey.

Bram woke up on the 13th and had a cup of coffee in the restaurant inside the hotel. He declined a full meal, but opted for a bagel instead. Then he headed out the door and up the street to the airfield. 

Once inside the terminal he spotted John, the man selling his plane. He introduced himself to John as Henry and they went out to the hangar. 

"She's an oldie, but a goodie. I bought her from the original owner. I've always taken good care of her, but now that I'm retirin' I need the gold more than the plane." John said.

Bram walked around the plane, looking underneath it, checking flaps, and looking for any obvious structural issues. 

"Mind if we take her out for a quick spin?" Bram asked, sure John would say no. 

"Ah, what the hell. It's a nice sunny day. I'll ask Lola if she'll give us some airspace."

When John returned he said "All clear, let's get movin'. She said we need to be off the ground in ten minutes or we will lose our window."

They both hopped in the 10 seater plane, which had been stripped down internally to only seat four, opting for cargo space instead. The controls appeared to be recently upgraded with modern electronics, the seats were in good shape, and the cockpit was clean. 

"You sure do take good care of your stuff John," Bram mentioned. 

"A man needs to take care of his tools, remember that."

Bram nodded.

A few pre-flight checks and they were taxiing to the runway. The plane purred like a kitten and seemed to respond well to the new control systems. 

Dawson has a well cared for runway. It must be due to all of the mining revenue that goes through here. 

"Here we go," John said over the comms.

The plane took off with no issues, smooth as could be. The owner adeptly operating the controls as if he had been doing so his entire life (he probably had been flying his entire life).

After a short 15 minutes in the air, Lola cleared them for landing.

"So we agreed to 100oz," said John.

"I think that seems fair," replied Bram.

He counted out 10x 10oz bars of gold and handed them over to John, who quickly pocketed them. With his left hand he handed over the keys to the plane. 

"Paperwork is in the cockpit, already signed. Good doin' business with you."

"Hey, how much time is left on the hangar rental?" Bram asked.

"'Bout three weeks, just paid up last week." 

"How much would you charge me to use the hangar for the next couple weeks while I prep for my trip?" Bram asked.

"Feel free to use it, I have no use for it. Make sure to leave it clean."

"Thank you, I will."

"Let me go introduce you to Lola, she'll take good care of you, especially if you drop an ounce her way."

With a small bribe Bram was able to have full access to the runway, all he needed was to ask Lola and she'd arrange it. Pretty small price to pay for secrecy and paperwork mishaps. 

---

Over the next two weeks Bram worked on the plane day and night. The old Cessna got a much needed retrofit of electronics that would keep him safe from tracking. A hacked transponder that could shift codes or be powered off with the push of a button, encrypted comms, and a sensor suite that could inform him of any tracking or nearby planes. Of course, he also prepped to rig the plane to self destruct like everything else he owns. 

When it came time to leave, he sanitized his room, checking for his prints and eliminating them. He set out a bunch of booze he had been buying throughout the last two weeks and then went down to the bar. He told a few folks there that Room 12 was unlocked and he had left a bunch of booze in there that he wasn't able to use since he had to return home on an emergency. "Feel free to invite your friends" he said. On his way out the front door of the hotel, he left a $20 bill with the front desk to tip house keeping.

This of course was a way to fill the room with additional fingerprints and to make a mess, which would overshadow any obvious signs of cleaning that he did to get rid of his prints. He came up with this trick a few years back when he had walked past an open door party in a hotel, which made him realize that a bunch of fake "data" on top of his obvious cleaning, followed by house cleaning needing to do a full cleaning on the room would surely erase any proof that he had been in that room. 

Bram had stopped worrying about cameras years ago, since he realized it was much easier to hide in plain sight than hide entirely. He found that keeping a low profile, tipping well (but not too well), wearing plain clothing, and staying at mid-grade establishments ensured that he was easy to miss.

A quick stop into Lola's office in the tower ensured he had his window to take off.

He loaded up the plane, then did a sweep of the hangar and wiped down any surfaces he had touched. 

Bram sat in the captain's chair of the plane and set the transponder to squawk the same code that the original had, not wanting to raise Lola's suspicions. He taxied out to the runway and took off. 

"Have a good one Lola" he said, as he passed the tower.

"Thanks Henry, safe flight."

---

Bram had spent all of his free time when not working on the plane to arrange for safe passage through about a dozen small and medium airports from Dawson to Campbeltown Airport in Scotland. Sometimes it took a well placed bribe, sometimes blackmail, others he just needed to insert some data into flight records and schedules. 

This was his least favorite part of his business, the travel planning. It was expensive, tedious, and dangerous. He is in the most danger when traveling, especially operating an airplane without a pilot's license, with a hacked transponder, under a fake identification. With all the effort he goes into getting high quality fake identification, he chuckled to himself that he never had the foresight to give one of his identities a pilot's license. "I'll have Shiv do that next time," he remarked to himself somewhere over Manitoba. 

He was thankful that the plane had a primitive autopilot function that would give him enough time to get up and stretch his legs, use the restroom, or just get lost in thought on this tedious journey. 

Bram thought about that night playing poker back in Nanutuk. Cleaning out Chief Roberts felt great, taking nearly $15,000 CAD off the table in one swoop was a gut check for Roberts, but wasn't a huge event for Bram. Poker was never about the money, but judging how well he could read people, or in this case, using it to take someone down. Roberts had a tell, when he was bluffing he would take a drink of his Bud Light and then pick at the label after setting it back down, while waiting for his opponent to respond. Testing this tell was easy, and Bram had done so dozens of times, with small hands, over a period of a few months. 

Bram had overheard, while in town at a bar, that Roberts had been involved in covering up a murder that the cops had committed. No one had direct proof but it seemed to be that people didn't think this was the first time, nor would it be the last. So, after doing some digging and following Roberts a few times, it became very clear that Roberts was shady, had a gambling problem, and was in to his bookie for a significant sum of money. Apparently he also had a payment coming due.

The night Bram took out Roberts in poker, Roberts was playing with the money he owed his bookie. Bram knew that he could bait him into a big hand and take his money. And he did. Roberts was furious, accused Bram of cheating (which he had no evidence of). He stood up in a rage, flipped over the table sending glasses, chips, and more all over the room. The two guys next to Roberts held him back while Bram grabbed his money and ran. 

Bram felt safe knowing that no one knew where his cabin was, but he knew they would eventually find the remains of the cabin once the snow cleared in a few months, which they would probably connect pretty quickly to his abrupt departure. By then though he would be far away from them, under a new identity, working on his next project.

It took about ten days to make the trip from Dawson to Campbeltown. The plane performed admirably, so much so that Bram was considering changing the name of the plane, but that was against his code of not getting attached to objects. For now, he decided he would just rent a hangar for it and pick up the car he had dropped off in the parking lot for him. He had a bunch of friendly contacts in Scotland who were happy to oblige when he asked for things. Dropping off a car seemed like the least that Donovan could do after the night of bingeing he had done in Bram's tasting room outside of Glenroths. 

Bram operates two tasting rooms, each at the bottom of a custom built whiskey vault. They are highly exclusive, invite only, and incredibly secure. The vaults are both located in Scotland, one outside of Glenroths, the other near Campbeltown. They were identical in design, looking just like a simple farmhouse out in the country. The grounds were well maintained, the properties large enough that the farmhouse could not be seen from the road.

There is a front door, with an armed guard on either side, and a back door, with an armed guard on either side. There are a few sniper nests that are well placed on the property that are occupied the day before, during, and after a tasting. The front gate to the property has a video intercom with a direct link to the inside intercom. 

Bram hopped in the car and navigated by memory to his Campbeltown vault. He planned on spending a few nights there. On his way, he stopped at a local electronics store to purchase a new phone to use while he was in the country. He pulled the small bag from the glovebox that Donovan had stashed for him containing his Scottish passport "Quinn MacGregor", a debit card and credit card, and a couple thousand in cash. 

He bought the cheapest iPhone he could find then got back in his car to complete the journey to his vault. 

It was a short 15 minute drive from downtown to the vault. He pulled up to the gate, the system quickly identified him by facial recognition and vocal imprint, then opened to allow him in. The guards inside the house didn't know he was coming, but that was not unusual. He didn't often announce his presence. 

When he pulled around the back of the house, the guards did not move, as they were instructed to keep stationary unless told otherwise. As he approached he said "at ease fellas", to which they relaxed a bit. One opened the door while the other resumed his post. The guards made Bram uneasy, feeling that they draw more attention, something that he was planning on remedying in the future by hardening the property a bit more, improving the technology used for security, then relieving the guards of duty at this location. He had other locations where it made more sense to utilize their skills, so he would re-assign them there later.

He went straight to the control room and said hello to Joshua and told him that he would be staying at the vault for a few days. He handed him a list of grocery items and other miscellaneous items that he would need and asked to send two men to town to pick them up. 

"Yes sir," Joshua responded. Even though they were roughly the same age, Joshua's military training ensured he called everyone by proper pronouns.

"I'll be getting unpacked and heading down into the vault to do some inventory."

"Aye," Joshua replied simply, then returned to his work.

---

Inside the farmhouse, it looks just as you would expect. Well worn furniture, a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom. The closet in the front hall has a false back which leads to the man lift into the vault. You can fit two people at a time on the lift, usually an operator and a guest. There is a biometric control system which unlocks the 12" solid steel bars that lock the lift in place. Once unlocked, the lift slowly descends into the vault.

The vault is around 40M deep and 10M in diameter. The walls are lined with hundreds of cubbies, each containing a single bottle of whiskey. Each box is individually addressable by the control computer at the bottom of the vault. There is a protective bulletproof glass pane in front of each bottle, which opens when the inventory system requests a bottle. 

Bram made his way into the closet and down into the bottom of the vault. As he descended, each row of bottles he passed slowly lit up in a brilliant white, then faded to warm white. He spent the time on the three minute lift ride to decide what type of whiskey he would like to drink. He vascilated between a single barrel, cask strength Rye, or a 30+ year Japanese whisky. In the end, he placed both selections into the inventory tablet and allowed random assignment.

His two choices generated around 50 options in his massive collection, then he saw one of his favorite sights, the cubbie containing this evenings bottle light up green. A robotic arm shot up the wall, racing up about midway and then moving over towards the green cubbie, now flashing green. As the arm approached, it slowed down, and the green color of the cubbie lighting slowly faded to a flashing amber. Then the glass door opened and the backlighting turned a brilliant blue. The robotic arm slowly grabbed the bottle and locked it in place on it's platform, then gently made it's way to the bar area.

Hibiki 30, he hadn't tried this one yet.

He had just a couple of rules for the vault:

- An opened bottle must be finished by day two
- No more than 3 guests, only 4 chairs available
- No smoking
- No pictures, videos, or bringing in electronic devices
- No clocks, watches, or other ways to tell time

He poured a healthy dram of the Hibiki and then sat down in his chair.

As he let the whisky rest, he laid his head back and took a few deep breaths to calm his body. The last week or so had been very hard on his body and he was exhausted. He could still feel and hear the drone of the plane in his body, something that he hoped would pass after a glass or two of a wonderful whisky. 

He clicked a button on the side table which dimmed the lights down from the top of the vault all the way down until the last 4 meters. When looking up, all he could see was pitch black. He felt as if he was in the safety of whisky's arms, protected from everything that could happen outside. And in fact he was.

Behind the bar was a tunnel that leads to a safe room, which is well equipped to protect him and three others for up to a month without any additional supplies. Inside the safe room are two other doors, which both lead to hallways, each leading to a well hidden escape hatch. The entire vault, safe room, and escape tunnels are built to sustain a nuclear attack. Overbuilt? Maybe. But he believed that whiskey should be protected, especially a collection as large as his. 

Inside this vault, there are over 25,000 different bottles of whiskey. Many bottles have duplicates. Some have up to a dozen backups. The replacement value of the contents of this vault couldn't be calculated because many of the whiskies are no longer being produced, are extremely rare, or are extremely old. His oldest bottles date back to the 1700's. 

He stuck his nose into the tulip shaped glass and took a deep inhale. Pear, caramel, almond. Then he followed up with a small sip, just enough to coat his tongue and swish around in his mouth. He tasted a bit of strawberry, more pear and caramel, and then finishes with baked apple, strawberry, and a bevy of other fruit notes.

He swallowed and allowed himself to enjoy the light burn and building up of saliva in his mouth. Then a second swallow of the saliva which gave him a chance at some other notes, primarily of other fruits. 

Bram took out his well worn tasting notebook from the table drawer and wrote down his notes for this whisky. 

He set the notebook on the table and took another sip. This time with his eyes closed, allowing him to fully enjoy the experience. _How would I secure this location more to allow it to be unmanned most of the time? What am I securing it from? Who am I securing it from?_

The vault has triple redundant fresh air supplies and conditioning, keeping it around 16C and 40% humidity. The air supplies are monitored with custom sensors to detect various airborne attacks and immediately seal off that supply. The entire volume of air in the vault is replaced every 5 minutes to ensure that airborne viruses do not stay in the air long. 

Electricity is supplied by four different geothermal systems and a solar energy farm 2 kilometers away, ensuring that he has an endless supply of electricity to keep the facility running. After three incorrect attempts at biometric entry into the vault, the main door is sealed for 24 hours. The only way that you can leave after that is to use one of the emergency exit tunnels.

The only place he felt that he could improve the security of the vault was on the grounds outside of the farmhouse. The farm itself is just a bit over 150 acres, so plenty of ways to get onto the property without knowing. If there were an attacker, they probably wouldn't come through the front gate. 

A network of sensors in the ground spread throughout the property could accurately identify movement, then he could use some strategically placed cameras with high powered infrared to zoom in and see what the sense movement was. This data could then be fed into facial recognition and then used for alerting purposes. These small technology improvements would be enough to make him feel comfortable in reducing guard count to one, inside the house. 

Bram spent the rest of the night working on his plan to improve the security of the vault while drinking about a third of the bottle of Hibiki. 

Once he was satisfied with the security improvements, he decided to design a bigger version of this vault that he would start using for hosting "clients" for tastings. He often would bribe high powered officials or business people with expensive whiskies, why not give them access to the most exclusive and largest whiskey rooms in the world? Once people are good and sauced, they tend to much more easily let go of their secrets. 

He sketched a few thoughts down:

- 100,000 bottle capacity
- 100M deep
- Seat up to 6
- Well hidden entrance
- Security Theater layer (body scan, wand, removal of jewelry, etc)
- Deep security using technology
- Well trained, armed server

"Okay, time to go to bed." Bram placed the glass in the dishwasher and placed the unfinished bottle in the opened bottle cubby. "I guess I need to bring a friend to help me finish this tomorrow," he said to himself. 

Then he got on the man lift and returned to the house. As he rose up the vault, the lights below him powered off as he went. _I'm gonna need more whiskey_ he thought.
