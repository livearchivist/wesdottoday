      <h2 class="title">Hey, I’m Wes, nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I’m an engineer with more than a decade of focus on enterprise architecture.
      </p>

      <p>My skills range from datacenter architecture to marketing and analyst relations. I also dabble in programming, mostly on personal projects, but also
        do quite a bit of automation work in Python day-to-day. 
        In the last two years I've been working as a Technical Marketing Engineer with a great team designing the <a href="https://nutanix.com/one-platform">Nutanix Test Drive</a> experience.</p>
      <p>I’m always interested to meet new folks and see what you're working on. Feel free to send me an email!</p>
