This CyberDeck is loosely based on [this beast](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/comments/ediskm/the_ergodox_splitdeck_is_done_for_now/) by u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery, but has been expanded to support some of my other interests. This deck is designed to be tethered, not having it's own power source beyond a small NUC-UPS to provide temporary power if removed. 

It will be heavy, solid, and offer a high level of performance. I will start out with the Intel NUC6i5SYB that I have on-hand, then move to one of the newer models once funds allow. The keyboard layout is yet to be chosen, but will be a split ortholinear model. I will have custom CNC cut metal plates made to ensure a good heavy feel for the keyboard. 

I intend to use aviation connectors between the keyboard sections and for power input. I will design a custom power cable, ethernet connector and a few other items to complete the design. 

This deck is still being fleshed out, but I figured I'd start collecting my thoughts here.
